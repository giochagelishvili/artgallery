# Art Gallery Website
 Art Gallery Website created by me using HTML & CSS.

I recently tackled a challenging project involving the recreation of a design using HTML and CSS. This particular project required the use of several tools and demanded a great deal of attention to detail in order to ensure that the layout remained responsive across various screen sizes.

After discovering the design on Figma, I got to work on crafting a homepage that provided an informative overview of an art gallery, as well as a second page dedicated to its location.

In the end, I am extremely pleased with the outcome and feel that the experience helped me to grow as a developer.
